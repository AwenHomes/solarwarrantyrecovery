                        <h3>Will this definitely work?</h3>
                        <p>I can't guarantee manufacturer approval, but most major manufacturers DO honor warranties even when installers fail. During our free assessment, I'll tell you honestly if your case is viable.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why should I pay you $500 upfront?</h3>
                        <p>Because preparing and submitting warranty claims takes 4-6 hours of work. The upfront fee covers this work. The 10% success fee only applies if we actually recover value for you.</p>

                        <h3>Can't I just do this myself?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely! But most homeowners get stuck because they don't know which manufacturer to call, what documentation is needed, or how to find contractors who'll do warranty work. I've done this before and know the process.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
                        <p>Typically 4-8 weeks from claim submission to resolution, depending on manufacturer response time and contractor availability.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if my warranty expired?</h3>
                        <p>Then I can't help with warranty recovery. During our free assessment call, we'll check warranty status first.</p>

                        <h3>My installer also made the panels. What happens?</h3>
                        <p>If your installer was also the equipment manufacturer (rare), and they're fully dissolved, warranty recovery is much harder. We'll discuss this in the assessment.</p>
