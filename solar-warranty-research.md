# Solar Warranty Recovery Research Summary

**Research Date**: November 20, 2025
**Purpose**: Understanding warranty claim processes for homeowners whose solar installers have gone out of business

---

## Executive Summary

**KEY FINDING**: All major manufacturers continue to honor product warranties even when the original installer goes out of business. However, there are significant challenges and variations in the process across manufacturers.

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
1. **Labor costs are NOT covered** by most manufacturer warranties - homeowners must pay for installation/removal
2. **Some manufacturers require claims through installers** - creating barriers for homeowners
3. **Documentation requirements vary significantly** across manufacturers
4. **Processing times range from 2-5 days to 4-8 weeks**
5. **Cash settlements instead of replacements** are becoming common (especially LG: 60% of claims = $150-400/panel)

## Business Opportunity Assessment

### ✅ VIABLE OPPORTUNITIES

1. **Labor Facilitation Service**
   - All manufacturers except Tesla exclude labor costs from warranties
   - Homeowners struggle to find qualified installers for one-off warranty jobs
   - **Potential service**: Network of installers willing to do warranty work; markup on labor

2. **Documentation & Claims Processing**
   - Complex documentation requirements vary by manufacturer
   - Homeowners unfamiliar with RMA processes
   - **Potential service**: Complete claim submission service for fee ($200-500/claim?)

3. **Installer Referral Network**
   - LG requires installer to receive shipments
   - Many homeowners don't have installer relationships post-bankruptcy
   - **Potential service**: Maintain relationships with installers willing to facilitate

4. **Cash Settlement Negotiations**
   - 60% of LG claims = cash settlements
   - Homeowners may not know fair settlement value
   - **Potential service**: Negotiate better settlements, take percentage of increase

### ⚠️ CHALLENGES TO CONSIDER

1. **Limited Manufacturer Margins**
   - Most manufacturers still handle claims directly (can't fully replace them)
   - Service is primarily facilitation, not full claim ownership

2. **State Licensing Requirements**
   - May need contractor licenses in multiple states
   - Or partner with licensed contractors (reduces margins)

3. **Liability Concerns**
   - If you facilitate installer selection, potential liability for poor workmanship
   - Need strong contracts and insurance

4. **Market Size Questions**
   - How many homeowners have orphaned systems needing warranty work?
   - How many will pay for claim facilitation vs. DIY?
   - What's the overlap with homeowners who can afford service?

5. **Manufacturer Relationships**
   - Building direct relationships with manufacturer warranty departments could help
   - But they may view you as unnecessary middleman

### 💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**TEST WITH**: Enphase and Q Cells first
- ✅ Clear direct-to-homeowner claim processes
- ✅ Good documentation on requirements
- ✅ Large installed base (Enphase dominant in microinverters)
- ✅ Homeowner still needs to hire installer (your value-add)

**AVOID INITIALLY**: LG (no longer manufacturing), SunPower (bankruptcy chaos)

**POTENTIAL PIVOT**: If manufacturer warranties are too smooth, consider:
- Extended warranty products for systems >10 years old
- Preventive maintenance subscriptions
- System monitoring services that identify warranty issues early

## Conclusion

**BUSINESS VIABILITY**: ⚠️ **MODERATE - Proceed with caution and targeted testing**

The warranty recovery business is **viable but challenging**. The key value proposition is **labor facilitation and documentation assistance**, not claim submission itself (manufacturers handle that).

**Success factors**:
1. Build strong installer network willing to do one-off warranty jobs
2. Develop deep expertise in manufacturer-specific documentation requirements
3. Target specific manufacturers with clear processes (Enphase, Q Cells)
4. Consider geographical focus on installer-scarce regions
5. Potentially pivot to extended warranties or maintenance services if manufacturer warranties prove too smooth

**Before investing heavily**:
- Complete phone calls to manufacturers to validate online findings
- Identify 5-10 potential customers to test demand
- Map out state licensing requirements
- Calculate realistic margins after installer fees
- Check if existing competitors have failed (and why)
